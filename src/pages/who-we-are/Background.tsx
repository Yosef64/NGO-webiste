              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Shalom began in 2010 when Dr. Sarah Johnson, an education
                specialist, led a volunteer mission to rural Guatemala. What
                started as a two-week educational outreach program became a
                life-changing experience that revealed the profound impact that
                dedicated resources and community partnership could achieve.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Witnessing children walking hours to attend overcrowded schools
                with limited resources, Dr. Johnson and her team realized that
                sustainable change required more than temporary assistanceâ€”it
                demanded long-term commitment and locally-driven solutions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                Upon returning home, she assembled a diverse team of educators,
                healthcare professionals, and community development experts who
                shared her vision of creating lasting change through
                collaborative, community-centered approaches.
